### The purpose of this repository 
Testing the Github Actions (GHA) variables values as progressing through the "gitops" pipeline.
1. On feature branch creation
2. Pull Request creation
3. Pull Request merged to master
4. Manual Workflow dispatch

### Background 
As a Gitlab CI/CD user and developer that start to use GHA, I wanted to learn the mechanics of the default environment variables in GHA. 
Using the power of the default environment variables can assist the building of a robust CI/CD.
